putting this idea in my head._

I expect most frontend developers reach for flexbox as their go-to way of laying out content and
they probably shouldn't. Not because flexbox is bad but because grid will be a better choice most of
the time. But if that's true why do we choose flexbox? Let's discuss it.

## Why you probably reach for flexbox before grid

**The first reason is pretty obvious: flexbox came first** so there's a good chance you've been
using it for longer than grid. The [W3C Spec for flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) hit
Release Candidate status back at the tail end of 2019 but it has been in browsers, in some form,
[since early 2010](https://caniuse.com/flexbox) with the final syntax arriving in 2012. Grid hit RC
status at the [end of 2020](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) after being in browsers
[since 2015](https://caniuse.com/css-grid) with modern Grid syntax hitting around early 2017.
Flexbox was around for three years in its final form before grid even hit browsers with another 2
years before both were at their final syntax. That's 3–5 years of practicing and building muscle
memory on a new tool that was exceptionally useful. That kind of inertia is hard to overcome without
conscious effort.

**The second reason is also fairly obvious: flexbox is simpler than grid** which means we teach it
to new developers before grid. Flexbox has only a handful of properties and mostly it boils down to
a few key questions:

- Do I want my layout to be vertical or horizontal?
- Do I want my layout to wrap?
- How do I want my children to align in the X and Y orientation?
- How do I want my children to grow or shrink?
- Do I want to move a child to the start or end of the layout?
- Is my starting point top, bottom, left, right?

Grid has all of those considerations plus a few more:

- Do I want to fill by row or column first?
- Do I want my layout to be explicit or implicit and to what degree?
- Do I want my children to inherit their parent's layout?

Grid also always cares about every direction where flexbox can only ever care about one direction,
be it the X or Y. You have to think of the entire layout holistically where flexbox has more local
considerations. Simply put, grid has more going on than flexbox and it only makes sense that we
would teach the simpler layout tool—which we should acknowledge is complex in its own right—before
we dive into the more complex tool. While that does make sense for teaching, once you've learned the
tools shouldn't we care more about what tool is best for the job?

## Why you should probably reach for grid anyway

Developers are always looking for a way to be more efficient and to build better things. We should
prioritize tools that help us achieve those goals without limiting us in ways we do not want. Framed
that way, Grid is just a better tool and if you have to choose one to master it should be your first
choice.

**Grid gives you a few things that you don't get with flexbox:**

- Absolute positioned elements become relative to the grid cell.
- No more hard-coded heights layouts just so everything in a row is the same size.
- Named grid areas make full-page layouts a breeze to throw together and easy to adjust wen flowing
  form mobile to desktop layouts, all within a single property (remember, this, we'll come back to
  it).
- Children with a consistent internal layout that's aware of all its siblings' layouts (subgrid is
  really cool, you guys).
- More control for intrinsic sizing (which you can still ignore) means your layouts are inherently
  more robust.

And there's plenty more. On the other hand the only thing flexbox gives you over grid is the
independent layout of rows or columns when your content wraps. That's not nothing but it is of
limited utility given most of the time the design you need to implement is going to consider both
directions in concert.

These additional traits make grid great not just for building full page layouts but for constructing
smaller components too. Let's go through an example. What if you want to center one item in a parent
both vertically and horizontally? Lots of space, put it in the middle. Here's how flexbox and grid
compare:

```css
/* with flexbox */
.wrapper {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

/* with grid */
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
}
```

OK, not bad. Grid wins but only by a single property and this is a pretty simple problem to solve
anyway. What if you want the content centered when there's enough space and for it to scroll
vertically when there's not? Like if you want to center a dialog on the screen but allow it to
scroll on the screen (not within the dialog) for some reason. How would that play out? Let's see:

```css
/* with flexbox */
.wrapper {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    overflow: auto;

    /* this is essentially a hack that adds empty children to push the other content around when there's space */
    &::after,
    &::before {
        content: '';
        flex: 1;
    }

    /* we need to stop our real child from squishing, which it might depending on its intrinsic size' */
    > * {
        flex: 0 0 auto;
    }
}

/* with grid things remain unchanged. */
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

Suddenly that delta increases. Now imagine you wanted margins around that child...

The reason this works is because flexbox is designed to be flexible and less opinionated on what
happens to your content. grid is intentionally rigid and most of the time we're going to want that.

What about our good friend the card layout?

```css
/* with flexbox */
.wrapper {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: wrap;

    > * {
        flex: 1 1 200px;
    }
}

/* with grid */
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
```

You end up with a similar result but with fewer properties and everything is on the parent. The
bonus is that all your cards will be the same height, a thing you simply cannot do in flexbox.

### But sometimes flexbox can be better, kinda

If all you want is an implicit layout that's single direction, flexbox has the edge. Imagine you
have a row of items and you want there to be a gap between the last two. This might be a menu where
you want most of the controls aligned to the left and the final one, an important action, on it's
own on the right. Here's how that would look with Flexbox:

```css
.wrapper {
    display: flex;

    > * {
        flex: 0 0 auto; /* might be necessary depending on intrinsic size so it's good to have */
        &:last-child {
            margin-inline-start: auto;
        } /* pushes our last child to the far right */
    }
}
```

That's not too bad, right? Reasonably concise and only one small potential issue we'd need to avoid.
What about grid?

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(1000, auto) 1fr auto; /* spot the hack? */

    > *:last-child {
        grid-column: 1002;
    }
}
```

OK, that's not too bad. CSS sometimes requires hacks and we're definitely doing that here. We've
created 1,002 implicit columns with the second to last oe taking up as much space as possible and
our important action sitting in the 1,002nd column. But there's a downside to this hack: You can't
use `gap` anymore. The Gap property does not collapse if a cell is empty so if you try to use that
to space your buttons out you're gonna have a bad time. Of course, you can solve that problem with
some simple margins but it _is_ a problem you need to solve and a trade-off we should acknowledge.

However, not to get too excited for flexbox, a more realistic version of that would be an more
explicit grid since a menu's content is pretty well known. You're likely to know what controls are
going to be available and how many there are so you're more likely to do this:

```css
/* maybe this? */
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, auto) 1fr auto;

    > *:last-child {
        grid-column: 6;
    }
}
```

Looks like a winner, right? Fewer properties, most of which are on the parent, means we have a
clearer understand of exactly what our layout is doing when we look at our code. If someone adds an
unexpected child and breaks the layout where you apply the fix is pretty clear.

Which solution makes more sense will depend on a few things but a big one is do you know how many
children will be in the menu and are you OK with using margins instead of gaps.

## In the end just use what works for you

One of my favorite aspects of frontend development is that there's no one way to solve any problem.
Before flexbox and grid we used to do most of this with floats and positioning. Before that they
used tables. All of the old ways are still viable, it's just the new ways are better. They're more
reliable, more powerful, more semantic, more accessible, more predictable. They're just better.

Before we wrap this up, I do have one last final reason to use grid over flexbox: You're going to
use grid anyway. Remember how I said named grid areas let you define complex layouts and rearrange
them for responsiveness? These days you're almost certainly doing your main layout with a grid so no
matter what you will be using grid on every single project. But you can't say the same thing about
flex, can you?

So if you're always going to have to use one, which one should you focus your energy on mastering?

Honestly the answer is both but prioritize grid.
